# Jwaita - Dark Adwaita- and Papirus-Inspired JWM Theme and Button Sets
I made my own JWM theme because the existing ones look out of place when used with my Adwaita Dark + Papirus setup.

## How to apply the theme
1. Download the repo and unzip it somewhere
2. Copy the `Jawaita.theme` to `/home/username/.config/jwm/themes`
3. Copy the `Jwaita` and `Jwaita-Papirus` subfolders in the `buttons` folder to `/home/username/.config/jwm/themes/buttons`
4. Open [JWM Kit](https://codeberg.org/JWMKit/JWM_Kit/) Settings
5. Go to Appearance settings
6. In the Theme tab, select `Jwaita`
7. In the Buttons tab, select `Jwaita` or `Jwaita-Papirus` *(Note: if the options are grayed out, you need to flip the switch to the left of the Apply button)*
